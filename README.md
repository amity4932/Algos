Implementation of well-known (and some rare) algorithms, mostly in C++.

## Contents
For algorithms and data structures in C++, check out the list [here](C++).

## My goal
> Add at least 1 algorithm to the repo every week.

### Want to contribute to open-source and help me achieve the goal?
1. **Fork** the repo
2. Create a **branch** and **add your implementation** of an algorithm that is not already in the repo
3. Submit a **pull request** (after reading the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md))

#### Want to suggest some algorithms to add?
Just [create a new issue](https://github.com/faheel/algos/issues/new "Create a new issue") and I'll handle it from there :smile:
